## A 1-D cellular automaton to test possible mechanisms of SYP-1-phos enrichment to the "short arm" of the chromosome.

A 1D "chromosome" contains a certain number of cells. Each cell has 4 properties that can range from 0 to some maximum value. These properties are: the number of non-phosphorylated SYP-1 molecules; the number of phosphorylated SYP-1 molecules; the level of phospho-targets of PLK-2 (or of PLK-2 itself), and the level of an antagonist that dephosphorylates PLK-2 targets.
